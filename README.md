every hour?? or something to access proper wifi

• Basically any Hostlers in SIT or anyone in SIT who has to login through SONIC WALL NETWORK SECURITY LAYER
## SETUP 
• Download the repo or clone it or something  but most importantly move the "wifilogin" folder into C drive

• Make sure you have a the modules and libraries mentiond in the "requirements.txt" file
    You can install by the following command
```
pip install -r /C/wifilogin/requirements.txt
```
• Edit the "sample.txt" file , in that enter your "USN" and the "wifi password" IN THE SAME FORMAT SHOWN BELOW
